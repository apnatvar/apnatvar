- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @apnatvar. 3rd Year Computer Engineering Student at Trinity College Dublin. Welcome.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ML/AI/Data Science and I hope to build a career in this field. Currenlty looking to Intern in this field.
- ðŸŒ± I was focussing on ML/Deep Learning during my winter break. Since my next semester has begun, I will be focussing chiefly on the classrom. I will probably be working on smaller python and c codes to keep in touch with these languages. 
- ðŸ“« Available on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/apnatva-singh-rawat or email me at arawat@tcd.ie. 

A lot of the code uploaded on this git would code I have written for various modules in Computer Engineering. I will work to update these regularly but 
there will be an assured update at the end of each semester. 
Some of the codes are from courses/books etc that I undertook during summer/winter holidays.

*Some of the projects that I have worked on/contributed to are* 

1. https://github.com/apnatvar/FSM-MiniALU - This folder contains the FSM and MiniALU (added soon) projects that I worked on for Digital Systems Design. The FSM could detect a 12-bit pattern in a 21-bit output from an LFSR. Verilog was used to display the LFSR output bits on an FPGA board. The output from the LFSR was visible on the LEDs of the Xilinx FPGA board while the 7 segment display was used to show the number of times the 12-bit pattern was detected. The Mini ALU could perform functions limited to 6-bit binary addition, subtraction, bitwise XNOR, and negation based on the input from an FPGA board. The input was taken through 3 buttons giving the user 8 possible functions to choose from. The value to input was also from multiple switches in a 6-bit binary format. The result was computed based on the operation decided by the user and displayed through the LEDs, again in an 6-bit binary format.
2. https://github.com/apnatvar/arduino-tinkercad - This folder contains various small codes for Ultrasonic Sensor, DC Motors and more that I wrote to practice while developing an Autonomous Buggy. It also contains code for a mini project Touchless Sanitiser Dispenser. All of these were to be implemented on a Small Autonomous Buggy for an Engineering Design Project but because of Covid-19 I was not able to work with a physical device to see my code work. The Arduino code was written for a miniature battery-powered vehicle that could drive itself on a designated track. It used an Ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles, an Infrared sensor to stay on the path. Data was passed to Arduino which controlled the movement of the buggy.
3. https://github.com/apnatvar/Data-Structures-Sem-5 - This contains C code that I wrote for my module. There is more info in the Readme of that repo.
4. https://github.com/apnatvar/Microprocessor-Systems-Sem-5 - This contains Assembly code that I wrote for my module. Open the repo for more info.
5. https://github.com/apnatvar/practiceCodes - This is honestly one of my favourite and most used repos. As I work and learn, I practice that to either build my own little code, or solve questions online. This repo stores everything that I wrote outside of any projects, coursework etc. They are simple, small standalone codes that one can use in their larger codes or just simply to look for solutions to minor problems.
6. https://github.com/apnatvar/ML-AI-Deep-Learning - I have completed a few courses, ready books that would help me develop a good understanding in the fields of ML, AI and so on. Some of the code here was provided to me via the instructor or the book but I have made my own modifications to it. I prefer learning by doing and so this repo exists as a way to accumulate everything. This would hopefully help me in my future endeavours.
