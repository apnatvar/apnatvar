👋 Hi, I’m **@apnatvar**

I’m a **2× year old Software Developer, Storyteller, and Designer**.  
I like building things where logic meets layout and where ideas ship instead of staying in draft.

I built **https://apnatva.vercel.app** because markdown just isn’t as fun.  
**https://apnatva.vercel.app/visual** , a curated portfolio where I experiment, iterate, and occasionally over-engineer (intentionally).
There’s also **https://samples-ap.vercel.app**, an UI collection built using shadcn, tailwind, and typescript
