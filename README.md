- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @apnatvar. Recent Computer Engineering Graduate (TCD). Currently working as SDE 1, looking for new opportunities actively. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Development (Cloud-based), DevOps, and CloudOps roles. 
- ðŸŒ± I was focussing on ML/Deep Learning during my college years apart from basic Computer Engineering. My recent work experience was developing and maintaining a cloud-based application and I worked with several tools like Kubernetes, Kafka, Nats, Helm, Azure, Linux, and so much more.  
- ðŸ“« Available on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/apnatva-singh-rawat or email me at arawat@tcd.ie. https://apnatvar.github.io/apnatvar.github.io/ is still under development but I would appreciate any feedback. 

A lot of the code uploaded on this git would code I have written for various modules in Computer Engineering. Other than that I took some external courses and any code I wrote in the fulfillment of the requirements of the course is presented here. 

### *Some of my favourite projects*
##### Cyclistic Data Analysis - https://github.com/apnatvar/analytics/tree/main/Cyclistic
##### S&P500 Stock Dashboard - https://github.com/apnatvar/analytics/tree/main/Shiny_Stock
##### Morse Code Game - https://github.com/apnatvar/Microprocessor-Raspberry-Pi-Pico/tree/main/Pi%20Pico%20Coding/assign02
##### FSM - https://github.com/apnatvar/FSM-MiniALU/tree/main/CodesForFSM/A2_RawatA.srcs
##### Blockchain based Vehicle Emissions Logger - https://github.com/apnatvar/Computer-Networking/tree/main/Project%202

### *All of the projects that I have worked on/contributed to in addition to codes I wrote for practice for interviews, various minor assignments and etc* 

##### 1. https://github.com/apnatvar/analytics - This folder contains case studies, visualisations, and other projects in R, Python and SQL. It is mostly a compilation of the efforts that I put in after completing the Google Data Analytics Course. 

##### 2. https://github.com/apnatvar/FSM-MiniALU - This folder contains the FSM and MiniALU (added soon) projects that I worked on for Digital Systems Design written entirely in Verilog and compiled using Vivado by Xilinx. The FSM could detect a 12-bit pattern in a 21-bit output from an LFSR. Verilog was used to display the LFSR output bits on an FPGA board. The output from the LFSR was visible on the LEDs of the Xilinx FPGA board while the 7 segment display was used to show the number of times the 12-bit pattern was detected. The Mini ALU could perform functions limited to 6-bit binary addition, subtraction, bitwise XNOR, and negation based on the input from an FPGA board. The input was taken through 3 buttons giving the user 8 possible functions to choose from. The value to input was also from multiple switches in a 6-bit binary format. The result was computed based on the operation decided by the user and displayed through the LEDs, again in an 6-bit binary format.

##### 3. https://github.com/apnatvar/arduino-tinkercad - This folder contains various small codes for Ultrasonic Sensor, DC Motors and more that I wrote to practice while developing an Autonomous Buggy. It also contains code for a mini project Touchless Sanitiser Dispenser. All of these were to be implemented on a Small Autonomous Buggy for an Engineering Design Project but because of Covid-19 I was not able to work with a physical device to see my code work. The Arduino code was written for a miniature battery-powered vehicle that could drive itself on a designated track. It used an Ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles, an Infrared sensor to stay on the path. Data was passed to Arduino which controlled the movement of the buggy.

##### 4. https://github.com/apnatvar/Data-Structures-Sem-5 - This contains C code that I wrote for my module. This involves a lot of linked lists, hash tables, searching techniques and etc. There is more info in the Readme of that repo.

##### 5. https://github.com/apnatvar/Microprocessor-Raspberry-Pi-Pico - This contains Assembly code that I wrote for my module. It has basic ARM Codes and then some complex program built using C and ARM and OpenOCD Degubber. Important things to focus on are the codes in Assign01(Solo Project - LED Game) and Assign02(Group Project - Morse Code Implementation) folders. Some sample codes are included in a sample folder which are more of an introductory codes for the Microprocessor-II module at Trinity College Dublin. Open the repo for more info.

##### 6. https://github.com/apnatvar/practiceCodes - This is honestly one of my favourite and most used repos. As I work and learn, I practice that to either build my own little code, or solve questions online. This repo stores everything that I wrote outside of any projects, coursework etc. These are small standalone codes that one can use in their larger codes or just simply to look for solutions to minor problems.

##### 7. https://github.com/apnatvar/ML-AI-Deep-Learning - I have completed a few courses, ready books that would help me develop a good understanding in the fields of ML, AI and so on. Some of the code here was provided to me via the instructor or the book but I have made my own modifications to it. I prefer learning by doing and so this repo exists as a way to accumulate everything. This would hopefully help me in my future endeavours.

##### 8. https://github.com/apnatvar/Computer-Networking.git - Computer Networking Module at Trinity College Dublin, Semester 2, Year 3. This involves Project 1 (Solo) and a Project 2 (Group) both written entirely in Python. For the latter, we went forward majorly with what I worked on in Project 1. The overall structure remains similar with improvements in multithreading, sending/recieving fsm. A database was also downloaded where queries can be run using SQL commands in Python.
