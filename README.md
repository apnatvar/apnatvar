- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @apnatvar. 3rd Year Computer Engineering Student at Trinity College Dublin. Welcome.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in gaining professional working experience via an Internship/Programmes/Community Involvement in ML/AI, or Software Developement.
- ðŸŒ± I was focussing on ML/Deep Learning during my winter break. Since my next semester has begun, I will be focussing chiefly on the classrom. I will probably be working on smaller python and c codes to keep in touch with these languages.
- ðŸ“« Available on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/apnatva-singh-rawat or email me at arawat@tcd.ie. 

A lot of the code uploaded on this git would code I have written for various modules in Computer Engineering. I will work to update these regularly but 
there will be an assured update at the end of each semester. 
Some of the codes are from courses/books etc that I undertook during summer/winter holidays.
