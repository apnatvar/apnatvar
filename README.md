- 👋 Hi, I’m @apnatvar. 2x year old Software Developer/Storyteller/Designer. 
- I made https://apnatva.vercel.app be because markdown just isn't as fun.
- There is also https://samples-ap.vercel.app, a portfolio/collection of sorts.
- 📫 Available on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/apnatva-singh-rawat or email me at arawat@tcd.ie/apnatvarawat90@gmail.com. 

Get in touch for contract/freelance/collaborative work in the context of website design and development. I am learning to design 3D elements, animations, static creatives, and more.
Languages/Tools - Python, SQL, TypeScript, Next.js, GSAP, Motion.dev, Three.js.

A lot of the code uploaded on this git would code I have written for various modules in Computer Engineering. Other than that I took some external courses, did some competitive practice, some contract work and some were there just because I was bored. Have a look!
